• CSS3: The styling language used to design the visual presentation of the application, ensuring a responsive and attractive user interface.


## Backend
• Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows for server-side scripting, enabling the development of scalable and high-performance network applications.  
• Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications, handling routing, and managing server-side logic.
## Database
• MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is used for storing user information, news articles, and other related data, offering scalability and high performance.  
• Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a schema-based solution to model application data. It simplifies data validation, casting, and business logic hooks.
